\title{Color to BGR Conversion}
\usage{
col2bgr(col, alpha = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{col}{Vector of any of the three kinds of R color specifications, i.e.,
either a color name (as listed by \code{\link{colors}}()), a hexadecimal
string of the form "\code{#rrggbb}" or "\code{#rrggbbaa}" (see
\code{\link{rgb}}), or a positive integer \code{i} meaning
\code{\link{palette}()[i]}.}

\item{alpha}{Logical value indicating whether the alpha channel (opacity)
values should be returned.}
}
\value{
An integer matrix with three or four (for \code{alpha = TRUE}) rows
and number of columns the length of \code{col}. If col has names these are
used as the column names of the return value.
}
\description{
R color to BRG (blue/green/red) conversion.
}
\details{
\code{\link{NA}} (as integer or character) and "NA" mean transparent.

Values of \code{col} not of one of these types are coerced: real vectors are
coerced to integer and other types to character. (factors are coerced to
character: in all other cases the class is ignored when doing the coercion.)

Zero and negative values of \code{col} are an error.
